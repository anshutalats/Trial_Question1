Selenium v3 is in use, and it comprises of IDE, WebDriver and Grid

Exceptions in Selenium:
TimeoutException: This exception is thrown when a command performing an operation does not complete in the stipulated time
NoSuchElementException: This exception is thrown when an element with given attributes is not found on the web page
ElementNotVisibleException: This exception is thrown when the element is present in DOM (Document Object Model), but not visible on the web page
StaleElementException: This exception is thrown when the element is either deleted or no longer attached to the DOM

Exception Test:
If you have written a test case in such way that it should throw an exception, 
then you can use the @Test annotation and specify which exception you will be expecting by mentioning it in the parameters. 
Take a look at the example below: @Test(expectedException = NoSuchElementException.class)

6. How can you redirect browsing from a browser through some proxy?
Selenium provides a PROXY class to redirect browsing from a proxy. Look at the example below:
String PROXY = &ldquo;199.201.125.147:8080&rdquo;;
org.openqa.selenium.Proxy proxy = new.org.openqa.selenium.Proxy();
proxy.setHTTPProxy(Proxy)
 .setFtpProxy(Proxy)
 .setSslProxy(Proxy)
DesiredCapabilities cap = new DesiredCapabilities();
cap.setCapability(CapabilityType.PROXY, proxy);
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(cap);

7. What is POM (Page Object Model)? What are its advantages?
Page Object Model is a design pattern for creating an Object Repository for web UI elements. 
Each web page in the application is required to have it’s own corresponding page class. 
The page class is thus responsible for finding the WebElements in that page and then perform operations on those WebElements.
The advantages of using POM are:
Allows us to separate operations and flows in the UI from Verification – improves code readability
Since the Object Repository is independent of Test Cases, multiple tests can use the same Object Repository
Reusability of code

Page Factory gives an optimized way to implement Page Object Model.
When we say it is optimized, it refers to the fact that the memory utilization is very good 
and also the implementation is done in an object oriented manner.
Uses By()

9. What are the different types of WAIT statements in Selenium WebDriver? Or the question can be framed like this: 
How do you achieve synchronization in WebDriver?
There are basically two types of wait statements: Implicit Wait and Explicit Wait.
Implicit wait instructs the WebDriver to wait for some time by polling the DOM. 
Once you have declared implicit wait, it will be available for the entire life of the WebDriver instance.
By default, the value will be 0. If you set a longer default, 
then the behavior will poll the DOM on a periodic basis depending on the browser/ driver implementation.
Explicit wait instructs the execution to wait for some time until some condition is achieved. Some of those conditions to be attained are:
elementToBeClickable
elementToBeSelected
presenceOfElementLocated

14. How to handle keyboard and mouse actions using Selenium?
We can handle special keyboard and mouse events by using Advanced User Interactions API.
clickAndHold()	Clicks (without releasing) the current mouse location.
dragAndDrop()	Performs click-and-hold at the location of the source element, moves.
source, target()	Moves to the location of the target element, then releases the mouse.

15. What are different types of frameworks?
The different types of frameworks are:
Data Driven Framework:-
Keyword Driven Framework:-
Hybrid Framework:-

18. What is Selenese?
Selenese is the set of selenium commands which are used to test your web application.
You can even make use of:
Actions: Used for performing operations
Assertions: Used as checkpoints
Accessors: Used for storing a value in a particular variable

19. Can Selenium handle window pop-ups?
Selenium does not support handling pop-ups. Alert is used to display a warning message. It is a pop-up window that comes up on the screen.
Void dismiss(): This method is called when the ‘Cancel’ button is clicked in the alert box.
Void accept(): This method is called when you click on the ‘OK’ button of the alert.
String getText(): This method is called to capture the alert message.
Void sendKeys(String stringToSed): This is called when you want to send some data to alert box.

Assert: An assertion is used to compare the actual result of an application with the expected result.
Verify: There won’t be any halt in the test execution even though the verify condition is true or false.

25. Can you navigate back and forth the webpage in Selenium?
Yes. You can navigate in the browser. A few methods using which you can achieve it are:
driver.navigate.forward
driver.manage.back
driver.manage.navigate
driver.navigate.to(“url”)
